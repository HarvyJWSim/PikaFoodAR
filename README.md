## What is this about?
The food products in grocery stores are labelled with terms that include ingredients and food additives that are difficult to comprehend, particularly their safety to consumer’s health. As a result, consumers make unwise purchase decision due to inability to appraise the safety of the food products, causing a deterioration in overall health. For consumers with certain disease at risk or in concern, lack of knowledge in diet-disease relationship also causes them to have difficulty in selecting suitable food products. 


This project aims to **facilitate consumer in assessing risk level of food additives and receiving personalised recommendation of food ingredients based on consumer’s current health condition**, whereby both of this information will assist consumers in making decision when purchasing packaged food. A mobile application utilising** Augmented Reality** (AR) technology is proposed, in which useful information about ingredients and food additives is presented to the consumer by **overlaying the digital information in real-world environment**. The personalised recommendation of food ingredients for the consumer is performed based on the disease at risk or in concern, which increases the awareness of diet-disease relationship. After detecting and digitising the food labels, smart matching is performed with the food additives data in the repository obtained from official sites. The expected outcome is an AR mobile application that informs consumers of the risks and benefits of food additives and ingredients, thus leading to a better purchase decision. As a result, a better diet practice with smarter purchase decision and awareness in diet-disease relationships will lead the consumer to a better health condition.
